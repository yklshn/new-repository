Hear your heartbeat
Beat a frantic pace
And it's not even seven AM
You're feeling the rush
of anguish settling
You cannot help showing them in.
Hurry up then
Or you'll fall behind and
They will take control of you
And you need to heal
The hurt behind your eyes
Fickle words crowding your mind

So
Sleep, sugar, let your dreams flood in,
Like waves of sweet fire, you're safe within
Sleep, sweetie, let your floods come rushing in,
And carry you over to a new morning
